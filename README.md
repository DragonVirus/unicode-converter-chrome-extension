##Zawgyi Text to Unicode Converter (Chrome Extension)

Chrome Extension which would convert selected text into unicode text. 

This extension is for people like me who stubbornly don't want to change the font style to read the text. But sometimes when you want to read some text on facebook or some people message you with zawgyi, it's a bit troublesome. So, this extension will just converted the selected text into unicode text which is awesome. :D
